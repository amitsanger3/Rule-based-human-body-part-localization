[comment]: <> (The paper details the development and validation of a computational framework that combines traditional face detection algorithms, like Haarcascade, with advanced methods such as YOLOv9 and fully connected Convolutional Neural Networks &#40;CNNs&#41;. The methodology is rigorously tested across multiple datasets to ensure accuracy and robustness in various scenarios, including high-fashion contexts and everyday street scenes.)

## Methodology
The core of our methodology is a multi-stage process that includes:
- Face detection using Haarcascade and YOLOv9
- Verification of detected faces with a fully connected CNN
- Person detection in images using novel Pixel Intensity based model and yolov9.
- Fashion frame detection to isolate and analyze garment and body part features

## Datasets
The study utilizes several publicly available datasets, such as Fashionpedia, DARN, and Fashion10000, providing a diverse range of images for analysis. Real-time videos and images from sources like Pexels are also included to demonstrate the model's practical applications.
